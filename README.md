# summon-lib

This repo contains libraries for the [Summon](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/summon) language.

Because of Summon's close similarity to TypeScript, the code will often work correctly in JS runtimes. Testing is currently in Deno, but this is just the current convenience and it may change at any time.
